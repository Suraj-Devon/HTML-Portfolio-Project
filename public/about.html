<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Suraj. I have completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) with first division.<br>
I have a strong interest in AI and ML, as they were part of my course, and I am always excited to learn more in these fields.</p>

<p>Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning web development and Python.<br>
I already have a decent knowledge of SQL and Tableau, which helps me in understanding data and working with databases effectively.</p>

<p>One of my favorite hobbies is dancing.<br>
Itâ€™s something I love doing in my free time to stay active and express creativity.<br>
I also enjoy reading manhua, which is a great way to immerse myself in different worlds and stories.</p>

<p>When I am not dancing or reading, I love watching anime.<br>
It's an awesome escape and a way to relax while experiencing great storytelling and animation.<br>
I have a curious mind and love exploring new things, whether in technology or in my personal interests.</p>
